    "# Social Data Mining 2016 - Assignment 1: Know your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session you will have the option to choose from **several** of the datasets that we have prepared. Be sure that you find them interesting enough to motivate your scientific curiousity. A bit of information on them to help you choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Titanic**: Passenger information of the most famous shipwreck in history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UCI HAR**: Participants were asked to carry out several actions while their mobile phones recorded gyroscope and accelerometer information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game of Thrones**: These are **two** datasets that capture information from Game of Thrones (tv) / A Song of Ice and Fire (book). One contains information on characters, the other on battles. Needless to say, it might contain potential spoilers if you're not caught up.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pokémon**: Shamelessly riding the Pokémon Go hype we prepared a dataset with Pokémon up until the current generation, listing their stats, type, and colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "All above can be found at https://github.com/cmry/social-data-mining/tree/master/Week%201%20-%20Introduction. Click on the `.arff` `-->` raw `-->` right click `save page as` `-->` make sure it's saved as `.arff` and NOT `.txt`!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Why do I need to see more than one dataset? \n",
    "\n",
    "> A: Different sets require different interpretations. Some are big, some small, some have a lot of features, some have very few features, some require expert knowledge, some are very intuitive. Its good to compare these sets on all tasks on these points. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 - Interpreting Raw Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first step as a data scientist is (as frequently repeated in the lecture) to *know* your data. Everyone can learn to fire up a program and click a few buttons. It is *your* task, however, to understand this data and generate creative insights and be able to communicate these (in the form of a scientific paper or bussiness presentation). It is therefore important to know the possibilities and limitations of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `.arff` found in any of your selected datasets' directories in a flat text editor (e.g. `notepad` for windows, `textedit` for mac, and `gedit` for linux). WEKA has a unique format to record datasets and their structure, information on which can be found at http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/arff.html. It globally splits up in three blocks: the documentation (prepended with `%`), the features (prepended with `@`), and the data (separated by `,`).  Make sure that you read the documentation, which provides (a link to) the required information to intepret and reason about your data without doing anything related to Data Mining yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of data you see in the `.arff` file is called a **feature vector**. A vector here we see as row of values or attributes (**features**) that describe each instance. An instance can be a passenger (titanic), person (UCI HAR), or character (GoT). Their features can be `numeric` (some number) or `nominal` (one of a restricted set of labels). So for Titanic, the ticket price paid by the passengers is numeric, whilst their gender is nominal. Nominal values can again be transformed to a number (0 for male, 1 for female for example). The beauty of this is that each instance can be represented as a point in some graph. So say that we have a female that bought a 4 dollar ticket, and a male that bought an 8 dollar ticket, we would expect this graph to look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "             1|   x (female, 4)\n",
    "              |\n",
    "       gender |\n",
    "              |\n",
    "              |__________x_ (male, 8)\n",
    "             0     price   10\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see a bit further into this assignment, WEKA does a way better job at visualizing these feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the main classification task of the sets you have selected.\n",
    "2. Try to reason which features you think are informative for this classification problem.\n",
    "3. Was it easy to interpret the documentation? Does the data require expert knowledge? How do different sets compare in this regard? \n",
    "4. Can you find any features in these datasets that would allow for regression rather than the classification of the class label?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 - Interpreting Data using WEKA\n",
    "\n",
    "Now load the datasets you selected in WEKA `-->` Explorer `-->` Open file. We're not going into any tabs or other parts of WEKA yet, just purely looking at the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Above the histogram, select the class you determined in Task 1.1 is indicative of the classification task.\n",
    "6. In the left pane, click some of the features and explain for yourself what the colours indicate for this feature and try to interpret the `min`, `max`, `mean`, and `st. dev` and their relation to these features.\n",
    "7. Deduce from the histogram if there are already some features that are informative for the classfication task (i.e. there's a clear separation between classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 - Preliminary Manual Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Now select **one** of the datasets. If this is **NOT** the UCI HAR dataset (only numeric and a LOT of features to go through): click each of features, if it shows that an 'Attribute is neither numeric nor nominal', select it and click `Remove` (down below). Until you only have either numeric or nominal features left.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Are there any features left that might 'pollute' your classification (i.e. already give away information that directly relates to the label)? How can you judge from the histogram? Do some have no added value (like student number)? If so, remove those.\n",
    "9. What do you forsee will happen if we would keep those features?\n",
    "10. Why don't these features belong in our classification problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: my set of choice doesn't have any 'pollution', do I skip this?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A: open the Titanic set and try to answer these questions with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 - Visualizing Features using WEKA\n",
    "\n",
    "Now go to the `Visualize` tab (up top). If the plots and dots are too small on your screen, you can increase the PlotSize and / or Pointsize and click `update`. This screen gives you information where the features on the left are on the Y-axis, and features on top are on the X-axis (like the example in the quick refresher). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Can you find any features that are for the most part discernable (e.g. in different groups) by the label (remember, label has different colours)?\n",
    "12. Do any of the graphs show a (visual) correlation? How can you tell? What would this tell you about these two features?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5 - Extra: Back to the Drawning Board\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've gained some extra insight into these datasets, open their `.arff` files again in your text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Can you split or combine current features to create new features?\n",
    "14. Imagine you have other data available on the subject of one of your datasets, what features would you add to help classification?\n",
    "\n",
